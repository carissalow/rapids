RAPIDS is open source, documented, modular, tested, and reproducible. At the moment we support smartphone data collected with AWARE and wearable data from Fitbit devices. Tip Questions or feedback can be posted on the #rapids channel in AWARE Framework's slack . Bugs and feature requests should be posted on Github . Join our discussions on our algorithms and assumptions for feature processing . Ready to start? Go to Installation , then to Configuration , and then to Execution How does it work? \u00b6 RAPIDS is formed by R and Python scripts orchestrated by Snakemake . We suggest you read Snakemake\u2019s docs but in short: every link in the analysis chain is atomic and has files as input and output. Behavioral features are processed per sensor and per participant. What are the benefits of using RAPIDS? \u00b6 Consistent analysis . Every participant sensor dataset is analyzed in the exact same way and isolated from each other. Efficient analysis . Every analysis step is executed only once. Whenever your data or configuration changes only the affected files are updated. Parallel execution . Thanks to Snakemake, your analysis can be executed over multiple cores without changing your code. Code-free features . Extract any of the behavioral features offered by RAPIDS without writing any code. Extensible code . You can easily add your own behavioral features in R or Python, share them with the community, and keep authorship and citations. Timezone aware . Your data is adjusted to the specified timezone (multiple timezones suport coming soon ). Flexible time segments . You can extract behavioral features on time windows of any length (e.g. 5 minutes, 3 hours, 2 days), on every day or particular days (e.g. weekends, Mondays, the 1 st of each month, etc.) or around events of interest (e.g. surveys or clinical relapses). Tested code . We are constantly adding tests to make sure our behavioral features are correct. Reproducible code . If you structure your analysis within RAPIDS, you can be sure your code will run in other computers as intended thanks to R and Python virtual environments. You can share your analysis code along your publications without any overhead. Private . All your data is processed locally. How is it organized? \u00b6 In broad terms the config.yaml , .env file , participants files , and time segment files are the only ones that you will have to modify. All data is stored in data/ and all scripts are stored in src/ .

Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message Solution Please make sure the DATABASE_GROUP in config.yaml matches your DB credentials group in .env . Cannot start mysql in linux via brew services start mysql \u00b6 Problem Cannot start mysql in linux via brew services start mysql Solution Use mysql.server start Every time I run force the download_dataset rule all rules are executed \u00b6 Problem When running snakemake -j1 -R download_phone_data or ./rapids -j1 -R download_phone_data all the rules and files are re-computed Solution This is expected behavior. The advantage of using snakemake under the hood is that every time a file containing data is modified every rule that depends on that file will be re-executed to update their results. In this case, since download_dataset updates all the raw data, and you are forcing the rule with the flag -R every single rule that depends on those raw files will be executed. Error Table XXX doesn't exist while running the download_phone_data or download_fitbit_data rule. \u00b6 Problem Error in .local ( conn, statement, ... ) : could not run statement: Table 'db_name.table_name' doesn ' t exist Calls: colnames ... .local -> dbSendQuery -> dbSendQuery -> .local -> .Call Execution halted Solution Please make sure the sensors listed in [PHONE_VALID_SENSED_BINS][PHONE_SENSORS] and the [TABLE] of each sensor you activated in config.yaml match your database tables. How do I install RAPIDS on Ubuntu 16.04 \u00b6 Solution Install dependencies (Homebrew - if not installed): sudo apt-get install libmariadb-client-lgpl-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev Install brew for linux and add the following line to ~/.bashrc : export PATH=$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH source ~/.bashrc Install MySQL brew install mysql brew services start mysql Install R, pandoc and rmarkdown: brew install r brew install gcc@6 (needed due to this bug ) HOMEBREW_CC=gcc-6 brew install pandoc Install miniconda using these instructions Clone our repo: git clone https://github.com/carissalow/rapids Create a python virtual environment: cd rapids conda env create -f environment.yml -n MY_ENV_NAME conda activate MY_ENV_NAME Install R packages and virtual environment: snakemake renv_install snakemake renv_init snakemake renv_restore This step could take several minutes to complete. Please be patient and let it run until completion. mysql.h cannot be found \u00b6 Problem -------------------------- [ ERROR MESSAGE ] ---------------------------- <stdin>:1:10: fatal error: mysql.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERROR: configuration failed for package 'RMySQL' Solution sudo apt install libmariadbclient-dev No package libcurl found \u00b6 Problem libcurl cannot be found Solution Install libcurl sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev Configuration failed because openssl was not found. \u00b6 Problem openssl cannot be found Solution Install openssl sudo apt install libssl-dev Configuration failed because libxml-2.0 was not found \u00b6 Problem libxml-2.0 cannot be found Solution Install libxml-2.0 sudo apt install libxml2-dev SSL connection error when running RAPIDS \u00b6 Problem You are getting the following error message when running RAPIDS: Error: Failed to connect: SSL connection error: error:1425F102:SSL routines:ssl_choose_client_version:unsupported protocol. Solution This is a bug in Ubuntu 20.04 when trying to connect to an old MySQL server with MySQL client 8.0. You should get the same error message if you try to connect from the command line. There you can add the option --ssl-mode=DISABLED but we can't do this from the R connector. If you can't update your server, the quickest solution would be to import your database to another server or to a local environment. Alternatively, you could replace mysql-client and libmysqlclient-dev with mariadb-client and libmariadbclient-dev and reinstall renv. More info about this issue here DB_TABLES key not found \u00b6 Problem If you get the following error KeyError in line 43 of preprocessing.smk: 'PHONE_SENSORS' , it means that the indentation of the key [PHONE_SENSORS] is not matching the other child elements of PHONE_VALID_SENSED_BINS Solution You need to add or remove any leading whitespaces as needed on that line.

Currently for all intent and testing purposes the tests/data/raw/test01/ contains all the test data files for testing android data formats and tests/data/raw/test02/ contains all the test data files for testing iOS data formats. It follows that the expected (verified output) are contained in the tests/data/processed/test01/ and tests/data/processed/test02/ for Android and iOS respectively. tests/data/raw/test03/ and tests/data/raw/test04/ contain data files for testing empty raw data files for android and iOS respectively. The following is a list of the sensors that testing is currently available. Messages (SMS) \u00b6 The raw message data file contains data for 2 separate days. The data for the first day contains records 5 records for every epoch . The second day's data contains 6 records for each of only 2 epoch (currently morning and evening ) The raw message data contains records for both message_types (i.e. recieved and sent ) in both days in all epochs. The number records with each message_types per epoch is randomly distributed There is at least one records with each message_types per epoch. There is one raw message data file each, as described above, for testing both iOS and Android data. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Calls \u00b6 Due to the difference in the format of the raw call data for iOS and Android the following is the expected results the calls_with_datetime_unified.csv . This would give a better idea of the use cases being tested since the calls_with_datetime_unified.csv would make both the iOS and Android data comparable. The call data would contain data for 2 days. The data for the first day contains 6 records for every epoch . The second day's data contains 6 records for each of only 2 epoch (currently morning and evening ) The call data contains records for all call_types (i.e. incoming , outgoing and missed ) in both days in all epochs. The number records with each of the call_types per epoch is randomly distributed. There is at least one records with each call_types per epoch. There is one call data file each, as described above, for testing both iOS and Android data. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Screen \u00b6 Due to the difference in the format of the raw screen data for iOS and Android the following is the expected results the screen_deltas.csv . This would give a better idea of the use cases being tested since the screen_eltas.csv would make both the iOS and Android data comparable These files are used to calculate the features for the screen sensor The screen delta data file contains data for 1 day. The screen delta data contains 1 record to represent an unlock episode that falls within an epoch for every epoch . The screen delta data contains 1 record to represent an unlock episode that falls across the boundary of 2 epochs. Namely the unlock episode starts in one epoch and ends in the next, thus there is a record for unlock episodes that fall across night to morning , morning to afternoon and finally afternoon to night The testing is done for unlock episode_type. There is one screen data file each for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Battery \u00b6 Due to the difference in the format of the raw battery data for iOS and Android as well as versions of iOS the following is the expected results the battery_deltas.csv . This would give a better idea of the use cases being tested since the battery_deltas.csv would make both the iOS and Android data comparable. These files are used to calculate the features for the battery sensor. The battery delta data file contains data for 1 day. The battery delta data contains 1 record each for a charging and discharging episode that falls within an epoch for every epoch . Thus, for the daily epoch there would be multiple charging and discharging episodes Since either a charging episode or a discharging episode and not both can occur across epochs, in order to test episodes that occur across epochs alternating episodes of charging and discharging episodes that fall across night to morning , morning to afternoon and finally afternoon to night are present in the battery delta data. This starts with a discharging episode that begins in night and end in morning . There is one battery data file each, for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Bluetooth \u00b6 The raw Bluetooth data file contains data for 1 day. The raw Bluetooth data contains at least 2 records for each epoch . Each epoch has a record with a timestamp for the beginning boundary for that epoch and a record with a timestamp for the ending boundary for that epoch . (e.g. For the morning epoch there is a record with a timestamp for 6:00AM and another record with a timestamp for 11:59:59AM . These are to test edge cases) An option of 5 Bluetooth devices are randomly distributed throughout the data records. There is one raw Bluetooth data file each, for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files. WIFI \u00b6 There are 2 data files ( wifi_raw.csv and sensor_wifi_raw.csv ) for each fake participant for each phone platform. The raw WIFI data files contain data for 1 day. The sensor_wifi_raw.csv data contains at least 2 records for each epoch . Each epoch has a record with a timestamp for the beginning boundary for that epoch and a record with a timestamp for the ending boundary for that epoch . (e.g. For the morning epoch there is a record with a timestamp for 6:00AM and another record with a timestamp for 11:59:59AM . These are to test edge cases) The wifi_raw.csv data contains 3 records with random timestamps for each epoch to represent visible broadcasting WIFI network. This file is empty for the iOS phone testing data. An option of 10 access point devices is randomly distributed throughout the data records. 5 each for sensor_wifi_raw.csv and wifi_raw.csv . There data files for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There are also additional empty data files for both android and iOS for testing empty data files. Light \u00b6 The raw light data file contains data for 1 day. The raw light data contains 3 or 4 rows of data for each epoch except night . The single row of data for night is for testing features for single values inputs. (Example testing the standard deviation of one input value) Since light is only available for Android there is only one file that contains data for Android. All other files (i.e. for iPhone) are empty data files. Application Foreground \u00b6 The raw application foreground data file contains data for 1 day. The raw application foreground data contains 7 - 9 rows of data for each epoch . The records for each epoch contains apps that are randomly selected from a list of apps that are from the MULTIPLE_CATEGORIES and SINGLE_CATEGORIES (See testing_config.yaml ). There are also records in each epoch that have apps randomly selected from a list of apps that are from the EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES and EXCLUDED_APPS . This is to test that these apps are actually being excluded from the calculations of features. There are also records to test SINGLE_APPS calculations. Since application foreground is only available for Android there is only one file that contains data for Android. All other files (i.e. for iPhone) are empty data files. Activity Recognition \u00b6 The raw Activity Recognition data file contains data for 1 day. The raw Activity Recognition data each epoch period contains rows that records 2 - 5 different activity_types . The is such that durations of activities can be tested. Additionally, there are records that mimic the duration of an activity over the time boundary of neighboring epochs. (For example, there a set of records that mimic the participant in_vehicle from afternoon into evening ) There is one file each with raw Activity Recognition data for testing both iOS and Android data formats. (plugin_google_activity_recognition_raw.csv for android and plugin_ios_activity_recognition_raw.csv for iOS) There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files. Conversation \u00b6 The raw conversation data file contains data for 2 day. The raw conversation data contains records with a sample of both datatypes (i.e. voice/noise = 0 , and conversation = 2 ) as well as rows with for samples of each of the inference values (i.e. silence = 0 , noise = 1 , voice = 2 , and unknown = 3 ) for each epoch . The different datatype and inference records are randomly distributed throughout the epoch . Additionally there are 2 - 5 records for conversations ( datatype = 2, and inference = -1) in each epoch and for each epoch except night, there is a conversation record that has a double_convo_start timestamp that is from the previous epoch . This is to test the calculations of features across epochs . There is a raw conversation data file for both android and iOS platforms ( plugin_studentlife_audio_android_raw.csv and plugin_studentlife_audio_raw.csv respectively). Finally, there are also additional empty data files for both android and iOS for testing empty data files","title":"Test cases"},{"location":"developers/test-cases/#test-cases","text":"Along with the continued development and the addition of new sensors and features to the RAPIDS pipeline, tests for the currently available sensors and features are being implemented.

The data that RAPIDS pipes to your feature extraction code is ready to process. New Features for Existing Sensors \u00b6 You can add new features to any existing sensors (see list below) by adding a new provider in three steps: Modify the config.yaml file Create a provider folder, script and function Implement your features extraction code As a tutorial, we will add a new provider for PHONE_ACCELEROMETER called VEGA that extracts feature1 , feature2 , feature3 in Python and that it requires a parameter from the user called MY_PARAMETER . Existing Sensors An existing sensor is any of the phone or Fitbit sensors with a configuration entry in config.yaml : Phone Accelerometer Phone Activity Recognition Phone Applications Foreground Phone Battery Phone Bluetooth Phone Calls Phone Conversation Phone Data Yield Phone Light Phone Locations Phone Messages Phone Screen Phone WiFI Connected Phone WiFI Visible Fitbit Heart Rate Summary Fitbit Heart Rate Intraday Fitbit Sleep Summary Fitbit Steps Summary Fitbit Steps Intraday Modify the config.yaml file \u00b6 In this step you need to add your provider configuration section under the relevant sensor in config.yaml . See our example for our tutorial\u2019s VEGA provider for PHONE_ACCELEROMETER : Example configuration for a new accelerometer provider VEGA PHONE_ACCELEROMETER : TABLE : accelerometer PROVIDERS : RAPIDS : COMPUTE : False ... PANDA : COMPUTE : False ... VEGA : COMPUTE : False FEATURES : [ \"feature1\" , \"feature2\" , \"feature3\" ] MY_PARAMTER : a_string SRC_FOLDER : \"vega\" SRC_LANGUAGE : \"python\" Key Description [COMPUTE] Flag to activate/deactivate your provider [FEATURES] List of features your provider supports. Your provider code should only return the features on this list [MY_PARAMTER] An arbitrary parameter that our example provider VEGA needs. This can be a boolean, integer, float, string or an array of any of such types. [SRC_LANGUAGE] The programming language of your provider script, it can be python or r , in our example python [SRC_FOLDER] The name of your provider in lower case, in our example vega (this will be the name of your folder in the next step) Create a provider folder, script and function \u00b6 In this step you need to add a folder, script and function for your provider. Create your provider folder under src/feature/DEVICE_SENSOR/YOUR_PROVIDER , in our example src/feature/phone_accelerometer/vega (same as [SRC_FOLDER] in the step above). Create your provider script inside your provider folder, it can be a Python file called main.py or an R file called main.R . Add your provider function in your provider script. The name of such function should be [providername]_features , in our example vega_features Python function def [ providername ] _features ( sensor_data_files , time_segment , provider , filter_data_by_segment , * args , ** kwargs ): R function [ providername ] _ features <- function ( sensor_data , time_segment , provider ) Implement your feature extraction code \u00b6 The provider function that you created in the step above will receive the following parameters: Parameter Description sensor_data_files Path to the CSV file containing the data of a single participant. This data has been cleaned and preprocessed. Your function will be automatically called for each participant in your study (in the [PIDS] array in config.yaml ) time_segment The label of the time segment that should be processed. provider The parameters you configured for your provider in config.yaml will be available in this variable as a dictionary in Python or a list in R. In our example this dictionary contains {MY_PARAMETER:\"a_string\"} filter_data_by_segment Python only. A function that you will use to filter your data. In R this function is already available in the environment. *args Python only. Not used for now **kwargs Python only. Not used for now The code to extract your behavioral features should be implemented in your provider function and in general terms it will have three stages: 1. Read a participant\u2019s data by loading the CSV data stored in the file pointed by sensor_data_files acc_data = pd . read_csv ( sensor_data_files [ \"sensor_data\" ]) Note that phone\u2019s battery, screen, and activity recognition data is given as episodes instead of event rows (for example, start and end timestamps of the periods the phone screen was on) 2. Filter your data to process only those rows that belong to time_segment This step is only one line of code, but to undersand why we need it, keep reading. acc_data = filter_data_by_segment ( acc_data , time_segment ) You should use the filter_data_by_segment() function to process and group those rows that belong to each of the time segments RAPIDS could be configured with . Let\u2019s understand the filter_data_by_segment() function with an example. A RAPIDS user can extract features on any arbitrary time segment . A time segment is a period of time that has a label and one or more instances. For example, the user (or you) could have requested features on a daily, weekly, and week-end basis for p01 . The labels are arbritrary and the instances depend on the days a participant was monitored for: the daily segment could be named my_days and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 14 instances the weekly segment could be named my_weeks and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 2 instances. the weekend segment could be named my_weekends and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 2 instances. For this example, RAPIDS will call your provider function three times for p01 , once where time_segment is my_days , once where time_segment is my_weeks and once where time_segment is my_weekends . In this example not every row in p01 \u2018s data needs to take part in the feature computation for either segment and the rows need to be grouped differently. Thus filter_data_by_segment() comes in handy, it will return a data frame that contains the rows that were logged during a time segment plus an extra column called local_segment . This new column will have as many unique values as time segment instances exist (14, 2, and 2 for our p01 \u2018s my_days , my_weeks , and my_weekends examples). After filtering, you should group the data frame by this column and compute any desired features , for example: acc_features [ \"maxmagnitude\" ] = acc_data . groupby ([ \"local_segment\" ])[ \"magnitude\" ] . max () The reason RAPIDS does not filter the participant\u2019s data set for you is because your code might need to compute something based on a participant\u2019s complete dataset before computing their features. For example, you might want to identify the number that called a participant the most throughout the study before computing a feature with the number of calls the participant received from this number. 3. Return a data frame with your features After filtering, grouping your data, and computing your features, your provider function should return a data frame that has: One row per time segment instance (e.g. 14 our p01 \u2018s my_days example) The local_segment column added by filter_data_by_segment() One column per feature.

Your function will be automatically called for each participant in your study (in the [PIDS] array in config.yaml ) time_segment The label of the time segment that should be processed. provider The parameters you configured for your provider in config.yaml will be available in this variable as a dictionary in Python or a list in R.

In R this function is already available in the environment. *args Python only. Not used for now **kwargs Python only. Not used for now The code to extract your behavioral features should be implemented in your provider function and in general terms it will have three stages: 1. Read a participant\u2019s data by loading the CSV data stored in the file pointed by sensor_data_files acc_data = pd . read_csv ( sensor_data_files [ \"sensor_data\" ]) Note that phone\u2019s battery, screen, and activity recognition data is given as episodes instead of event rows (for example, start and end timestamps of the periods the phone screen was on) 2. Filter your data to process only those rows that belong to time_segment This step is only one line of code, but to undersand why we need it, keep reading. acc_data = filter_data_by_segment ( acc_data , time_segment ) You should use the filter_data_by_segment() function to process and group those rows that belong to each of the time segments RAPIDS could be configured with . Let\u2019s understand the filter_data_by_segment() function with an example. A RAPIDS user can extract features on any arbitrary time segment . A time segment is a period of time that has a label and one or more instances. For example, the user (or you) could have requested features on a daily, weekly, and week-end basis for p01 . The labels are arbritrary and the instances depend on the days a participant was monitored for: the daily segment could be named my_days and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 14 instances the weekly segment could be named my_weeks and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 2 instances. the weekend segment could be named my_weekends and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 2 instances. For this example, RAPIDS will call your provider function three times for p01 , once where time_segment is my_days , once where time_segment is my_weeks and once where time_segment is my_weekends . In this example not every row in p01 \u2018s data needs to take part in the feature computation for either segment and the rows need to be grouped differently. Thus filter_data_by_segment() comes in handy, it will return a data frame that contains the rows that were logged during a time segment plus an extra column called local_segment . This new column will have as many unique values as time segment instances exist (14, 2, and 2 for our p01 \u2018s my_days , my_weeks , and my_weekends examples). After filtering, you should group the data frame by this column and compute any desired features , for example: acc_features [ \"maxmagnitude\" ] = acc_data . groupby ([ \"local_segment\" ])[ \"magnitude\" ] . max () The reason RAPIDS does not filter the participant\u2019s data set for you is because your code might need to compute something based on a participant\u2019s complete dataset before computing their features. For example, you might want to identify the number that called a participant the most throughout the study before computing a feature with the number of calls the participant received from this number. 3.

There are two versions of Fitbit\u2019s sleep API ( version 1 and version 1.2 ), and each provides raw sleep data in a different format: Count & duration summaries . v1 contains count_awake , duration_awake , count_awakenings , count_restless , and duration_restless fields for every sleep record but v1.2 does not. API columns . Features are computed based on the values provided by Fitbit\u2019s API: efficiency , minutes_after_wakeup , minutes_asleep , minutes_awake , minutes_to_fall_asleep , minutes_in_bed , is_main_sleep and type .","title":"Fitbit Sleep Summary"},{"location":"features/fitbit-sleep-summary/#fitbit-sleep-summary","text":"Sensor parameters description for [FITBIT_SLEEP_SUMMARY] : Key Description [TABLE] Database table name or file path where the sleep summary data is stored. The configuration keys in Device Data Source Configuration control whether this parameter is interpreted as table or file. The format of the column(s) containing the Fitbit sensor data can be JSON or PLAIN_TEXT . The data in JSON format is obtained directly from the Fitbit API. We support PLAIN_TEXT in case you already parsed your data and don\u2019t have access to your participants\u2019 Fitbit accounts anymore. If your data is in JSON format then summary and intraday data come packed together. We provide examples of the input format that RAPIDS expects, note that both examples for JSON and PLAIN_TEXT are tabular and the actual format difference comes in the fitbit_data column (we truncate the JSON example for brevity).

Assumptions/Observations There are three sleep types (TYPE): main , nap , all . The all type contains both main sleep and naps. There are two versions of Fitbit\u2019s sleep API ( version 1 and version 1.2 ), and each provides raw sleep data in a different format: Count & duration summaries . v1 contains count_awake , duration_awake , count_awakenings , count_restless , and duration_restless fields for every sleep record but v1.2 does not. API columns . Features are computed based on the values provided by Fitbit\u2019s API: efficiency , minutes_after_wakeup , minutes_asleep , minutes_awake , minutes_to_fall_asleep , minutes_in_bed , is_main_sleep and type .","title":"RAPIDS provider"},{"location":"features/fitbit-steps-intraday/","text":"Fitbit Steps Intraday \u00b6 Sensor parameters description for [FITBIT_STEPS_INTRADAY] : Key Description [TABLE] Database table name or file path where the steps intraday data is stored.

Entropy cannot be obtained for a single app Assumptions/Observations Features can be computed by app, by apps grouped under a single category (genre) and by multiple categories grouped together (meta-categories). For example, we can get features for Facebook (single app), for Social Network apps (a category including Facebook and other social media apps) or for Social (a meta-category formed by Social Network and Social Media Tools categories). Apps installed by default like YouTube are considered systems apps on some phones. We do an exact match to exclude apps where \u201cgenre\u201d == EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES or \u201cpackage_name\u201d == EXCLUDED_APPS .

By default we use the category catalogue pointed by [APPLICATION_CATEGORIES][CATALOGUE_FILE] (see the Sensor parameters description table above) [MULTIPLE_CATEGORIES] An array of collections representing meta-categories (a group of categories). They key of each element is the name of the meta-category and the value is an array of member app categories. By default we use the category catalogue pointed by [APPLICATION_CATEGORIES][CATALOGUE_FILE] (see the Sensor parameters description table above) [SINGLE_APPS] An array of apps to be included in the feature extraction computation. Use their package name (e.g. com.google.android.youtube ) or the reserved keyword top1global (the most used app by a participant over the whole monitoring study) [EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES] An array of app categories to be excluded from the feature extraction computation. By default we use the category catalogue pointed by [APPLICATION_CATEGORIES][CATALOGUE_FILE] (see the Sensor parameters description table above) [EXCLUDED_APPS] An array of apps to be excluded from the feature extraction computation. Use their package name, for example: com.google.android.youtube Features description for [PHONE_APPLICATIONS_FOREGROUND][PROVIDERS][RAPIDS] : Feature Units Description count apps Number of times a single app or apps within a category were used (i.e. they were brought to the foreground either by tapping their icon or switching to it from another app) timeoffirstuse minutes The time in minutes between 12:00am (midnight) and the first use of a single app or apps within a category during a time_segment timeoflastuse minutes The time in minutes between 12:00am (midnight) and the last use of a single app or apps within a category during a time_segment frequencyentropy nats The entropy of the used apps within a category during a time_segment (each app is seen as a unique event, the more apps were used, the higher the entropy). This is especially relevant when computed over all apps. Entropy cannot be obtained for a single app Assumptions/Observations Features can be computed by app, by apps grouped under a single category (genre) and by multiple categories grouped together (meta-categories). For example, we can get features for Facebook (single app), for Social Network apps (a category including Facebook and other social media apps) or for Social (a meta-category formed by Social Network and Social Media Tools categories). Apps installed by default like YouTube are considered systems apps on some phones. We do an exact match to exclude apps where \u201cgenre\u201d == EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES or \u201cpackage_name\u201d == EXCLUDED_APPS . We provide three ways of classifying and app within a category (genre): a) by automatically scraping its official category from the Google Play Store, b) by using the catalogue created by Stachl et al. which we provide in RAPIDS ( data/external/stachl_application_genre_catalogue.csv ), or c) by manually creating a personalized catalogue. You can choose a, b or c by modifying [APPLICATION_GENRES] keys and values (see the Sensor parameters description table above).","title":"RAPIDS provider"},{"location":"features/phone-battery/","text":"Phone Battery \u00b6 Sensor parameters description for [PHONE_BATTERY] : Key Description [TABLE] Database table where the battery data is stored [EPISODE_THRESHOLD_BETWEEN_ROWS] Difference in minutes between any two rows for them to be considered part of the same battery charge or discharge episode RAPIDS provider \u00b6 Available time segments and platforms Available for all time segments Available for Android and iOS File Sequence - data/raw/ { pid } /phone_battery_raw.csv - data/interim/ { pid } /phone_battery_episodes.csv - data/interim/ { pid } /phone_battery_episodes_resampled.csv - data/interim/ { pid } /phone_battery_episodes_resampled_with_datetime.csv - data/interim/ { pid } /phone_battery_features/phone_battery_ { language } _ { provider_key } .csv - data/processed/features/ { pid } /phone_battery.csv Parameters description for [PHONE_BATTERY][PROVIDERS][RAPIDS] : Key Description [COMPUTE] Set to True to extract PHONE_BATTERY features from the RAPIDS provider [FEATURES] Features to be computed, see table below Features description for [PHONE_BATTERY][PROVIDERS][RAPIDS] : Feature Units Description countdischarge episodes Number of discharging episodes. sumdurationdischarge minutes The total duration of all discharging episodes. countcharge episodes Number of battery charging episodes. sumdurationcharge minutes The total duration of all charging episodes. avgconsumptionrate episodes/minutes The average of all episodes\u2019 consumption rates.

This is because relying on yielded minutes only can be misleading when a big chunk of those missing minutes are clustered together. For example, let\u2019s assume we are working with a 24-hour time segment that is missing 12 hours of data. Two extreme cases can occur: the 12 missing hours are from the beginning of the segment or 30 minutes could be missing from every hour (24 * 30 minutes = 12 hours). ratiovalidyieldedminutes would be 0.5 for both a and b (hinting the missing circumstances are similar). However, ratiovalidyieldedhours would be 0.5 for a and 1.0 for b if [MINUTE_RATIO_THRESHOLD_FOR_VALID_YIELDED_HOURS] is between [0.0 and 0.49] (hinting that the missing circumstances might be more favorable for b . In other words, sensed data for b is more evenly spread compared to a .","title":"RAPIDS provider"},{"location":"features/phone-light/","text":"Phone Light \u00b6 Sensor parameters description for [PHONE_LIGHT] : Key Description [TABLE] Database table where the light data is stored RAPIDS provider \u00b6 Available time segments and platforms Available for all time segments Available for Android only File Sequence - data/raw/ { pid } /phone_light_raw.csv - data/raw/ { pid } /phone_light_with_datetime.csv - data/interim/ { pid } /phone_light_features/phone_light_ { language } _ { provider_key } .csv - data/processed/features/ { pid } /phone_light.csv Parameters description for [PHONE_LIGHT][PROVIDERS][RAPIDS] : Key Description [COMPUTE] Set to True to extract PHONE_LIGHT features from the RAPIDS provider [FEATURES] Features to be computed, see table below Features description for [PHONE_LIGHT][PROVIDERS][RAPIDS] : Feature Units Description count rows Number light sensor rows recorded. maxlux lux The maximum ambient luminance. minlux lux The minimum ambient luminance. avglux lux The average ambient luminance. medianlux lux The median ambient luminance. stdlux lux The standard deviation of ambient luminance.

If you want to use only the GPS provider set [LOCATIONS_TO_USE] to GPS , if you want to use all providers (not recommended due to the difference in accuracy) set [LOCATIONS_TO_USE] to ALL , if your AWARE client was configured to use fused location only or want to focus only on this provider, set [LOCATIONS_TO_USE] to RESAMPLE_FUSED . RESAMPLE_FUSED takes the original fused location coordinates and replicates each pair forward in time as long as the phone was sensing data as indicated by the joined timestamps of [PHONE_DATA_YIELD][SENSORS] , this is done because Google's API only logs a new location coordinate pair when it is sufficiently different in time or space from the previous one. There are two parameters associated with resampling fused location. FUSED_RESAMPLED_CONSECUTIVE_THRESHOLD (in minutes, default 30) controls the maximum gap between any two coordinate pairs to replicate the last known pair (for example, participant A's phone did not collect data between 10.30am and 10:50am and between 11:05am and 11:40am, the last known coordinate pair will be replicated during the first period but not the second, in other words, we assume that we cannot longer guarantee the participant stayed at the last known location if the phone did not sense data for more than 30 minutes). FUSED_RESAMPLED_TIME_SINCE_VALID_LOCATION (in minutes, default 720 or 12 hours) stops the last known fused location from being replicated longer that this threshold even if the phone was sensing data continuously (for example, participant A went home at 9pm and their phone was sensing data without gaps until 11am the next morning, the last known location will only be replicated until 9am).

Features description for [PHONE_LOCATIONS][PROVIDERS][BARNETT] adapted from Beiwe Summary Statistics : Feature Units Description hometime minutes Time at home. Time spent at home in minutes. Home is the most visited significant location between 8 pm and 8 am including any pauses within a 200-meter radius. disttravelled meters Total distance travelled over a day (flights). rog meters The Radius of Gyration (rog) is a measure in meters of the area covered by a person over a day. A centroid is calculated for all the places (pauses) visited during a day and a weighted distance between all the places and that centroid is computed. The weights are proportional to the time spent in each place. maxdiam meters The maximum diameter is the largest distance between any two pauses. maxhomedist meters The maximum distance from home in meters. siglocsvisited locations The number of significant locations visited during the day. Significant locations are computed using k-means clustering over pauses found in the whole monitoring period. The number of clusters is found iterating k from 1 to 200 stopping until the centroids of two significant locations are within 400 meters of one another. avgflightlen meters Mean length of all flights. stdflightlen meters Standard deviation of the length of all flights. avgflightdur seconds Mean duration of all flights. stdflightdur seconds The standard deviation of the duration of all flights. probpause - The fraction of a day spent in a pause (as opposed to a flight) siglocentropy nats Shannon\u2019s entropy measurement based on the proportion of time spent at each significant location visited during a day. circdnrtn - A continuous metric quantifying a person\u2019s circadian routine that can take any value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a daily routine completely different from any other sensed days and 1 a routine the same as every other sensed day. wkenddayrtn - Same as circdnrtn but computed separately for weekends and weekdays. Assumptions/Observations Barnett's et al features These features are based on a Pause-Flight model. A pause is defined as a mobiity trace (location pings) within a certain duration and distance (by default 300 seconds and 60 meters). A flight is any mobility trace between two pauses. Data is resampled and imputed before the features are computed. See Barnett et al for more information. In RAPIDS we only expose two parameters for these features (timezone and accuracy limit). You can change other parameters in src/features/phone_locations/barnett/library/MobilityFeatures.R . Significant Locations Significant locations are determined using K-means clustering on pauses longer than 10 minutes. The number of clusters (K) is increased until no two clusters are within 400 meters from each other. After this, pauses within a certain range of a cluster (200 meters by default) will count as a visit to that significant location.

In our experiments these cases are less than 10% of the screen events collected and this happens because ACTION_SCREEN_OFF and ACTION_SCREEN_ON are sent when the device becomes non-interactive which may have nothing to do with the screen turning off . In addition to unlock/off episodes, in Android it is possible to measure the time spent on the lock screen before an unlock event as well as the total screen time (i.e. ON to OFF ) but these are not implemented at the moment. We transform iOS screen events to match Android\u2019s format, we replace lock episodes with off episodes (2 with 0) in iOS.

Hint Every time you see config[\"KEY\"] or [KEY] in these docs we are referring to the corresponding key in the config.yaml file. Database credentials \u00b6 Create an empty file called .env in your RAPIDS root directory Add the following lines and replace your database-specific credentials (user, password, host, and database): [ MY_GROUP ] user=MY_USER password=MY_PASSWORD host=MY_HOST port=3306 database=MY_DATABASE Warning The label MY_GROUP is arbitrary but it has to match the following config.yaml key: DATABASE_GROUP : &database_group MY_GROUP Note You can ignore this step if you are only processing Fitbit data in CSV files. Timezone of your study \u00b6 Single timezone \u00b6 If your study only happened in a single time zone, select the appropriate code form this list and change the following config key. Double check your timezone code pick, for example US Eastern Time is America/New_York not EST TIMEZONE : &timezone America/New_York Multiple timezones \u00b6 Support coming soon. Participant files \u00b6 Participant files link together multiple devices (smartphones and wearables) to specific participants and identify them throughout RAPIDS. You can create these files manually or automatically . Participant files are stored in data/external/participant_files/pxx.yaml and follow a unified structure . Note The list PIDS in config.yaml needs to have the participant file names of the people you want to process. For example, if you created p01.yaml , p02.yaml and p03.yaml files in /data/external/participant_files/ , then PIDS should be: PIDS : [ p01 , p02 , p03 ] Tip Attribute values of the [PHONE] and [FITBIT] sections in every participant file are optional which allows you to analyze data from participants that only carried smartphones, only Fitbit devices, or both. Optional: Migrating participants files with the old format If you were using the pre-release version of RAPIDS with participant files in plain text (as opposed to yaml), you can run the following command and your old files will be converted into yaml files stored in data/external/participant_files/ python tools/update_format_participant_files.py Structure of participants files \u00b6 Example of the structure of a participant file In this example, the participant used an android phone, an ios phone, and a fitbit device throughout the study between Apr 23 rd 2020 and Oct 28 th 2020 PHONE : DEVICE_IDS : [ a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 , dsadas-2324-fgsf-sdwr-gdfgs4rfsdf43 ] PLATFORMS : [ android , ios ] LABEL : test01 START_DATE : 2020-04-23 END_DATE : 2020-10-28 FITBIT : DEVICE_IDS : [ fitbit1 ] LABEL : test01 START_DATE : 2020-04-23 END_DATE : 2020-10-28 For [PHONE] Key Description [DEVICE_IDS] An array of the strings that uniquely identify each smartphone, you can have more than one for when participants changed phones in the middle of the study, in this case, data from all their devices will be joined and relabeled with the last 1 on this list.

For example, you might want to process data on every day, every morning, or only during weekends. RAPIDS offers three categories of time segments that are flexible enough to cover most use cases: frequency (short time windows every day), periodic (arbitrary time windows on any day), and event (arbitrary time windows around events of interest). See also our examples . Frequency Segments These segments are computed on every day and all have the same duration (for example 30 minutes). Set the following keys in your config.yaml TIME_SEGMENTS : &time_segments TYPE : FREQUENCY FILE : \"data/external/your_frequency_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE The file pointed by [TIME_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can only have 1 row. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your time segments length An integer representing the duration of your time segments in minutes Example label,length thirtyminutes,30 This configuration will compute 48 time segments for every day when any data from any participant was sensed. For example: start_time,length,label 00:00,30,thirtyminutes0000 00:30,30,thirtyminutes0001 01:00,30,thirtyminutes0002 01:30,30,thirtyminutes0003 ... Periodic Segments These segments can be computed every day, or on specific days of the week, month, quarter, and year. Their minimum duration is 1 minute but they can be as long as you want. Set the following keys in your config.yaml . TIME_SEGMENTS : &time_segments TYPE : PERIODIC FILE : \"data/external/your_periodic_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE # or TRUE If [INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS] is set to TRUE , RAPIDS will consider instances of your segments back enough in the past as to include the first row of data of each participant. For example, if the first row of data from a participant happened on Saturday March 7 th 2020 and the requested segment duration is 7 days starting on every Sunday, the first segment to be considered would start on Sunday March 1 st if [INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS] is TRUE or on Sunday March 8 th if FALSE . The file pointed by [TIME_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can have multiple rows. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your time segments. It has to be unique between rows start_time A string with format HH:MM:SS representing the starting time of this segment on any day length A string representing the length of this segment.It can have one or more of the following strings XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S repeats_on One of the follow options every_day , wday , qday , mday , and yday . The last four represent a week, quarter, month and year day repeats_value An integer complementing repeats_on . If you set repeats_on to every_day set this to 0 , otherwise 1-7 represent a wday starting from Mondays, 1-31 represent a mday , 1-91 represent a qday , and 1-366 represent a yday Example label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value daily,00:00:00,23H 59M 59S,every_day,0 morning,06:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 afternoon,12:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 evening,18:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 night,00:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 This configuration will create five segments instances ( daily , morning , afternoon , evening , night ) on any given day ( every_day set to 0). The daily segment will start at midnight and will last 23:59:59 , the other four segments will start at 6am, 12pm, 6pm, and 12am respectively and last for 05:59:59 . Event segments These segments can be computed before or after an event of interest (defined as any UNIX timestamp). Their minimum duration is 1 minute but they can be as long as you want. The start of each segment can be shifted backwards or forwards from the specified timestamp. Set the following keys in your config.yaml . TIME_SEGMENTS : &time_segments TYPE : EVENT FILE : \"data/external/your_event_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE # or TRUE The file pointed by [TIME_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can have multiple rows. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your time segments. If labels are unique, every segment is independent; if two or more segments have the same label, their data will be grouped when computing auxiliary data for features like the most frequent contact for calls (the most frequent contact will be computed across all these segments). There cannot be two overlaping event segments with the same label (RAPIDS will throw an error) event_timestamp A UNIX timestamp that represents the moment an event of interest happened (clinical relapse, survey, readmission, etc.). The corresponding time segment will be computed around this moment using length , shift , and shift_direction length A string representing the length of this segment. It can have one or more of the following keys XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S shift A string representing the time shift from event_timestamp . It can have one or more of the following keys XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent a number of days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S . Use this value to change the start of a segment with respect to its event_timestamp . For example, set this variable to 1H to create a segment that starts 1 hour from an event of interest ( shift_direction determines if it\u2019s before or after). shift_direction An integer representing whether the shift is before ( -1 ) or after ( 1 ) an event_timestamp device_id The device id (smartphone or fitbit) to whom this segment belongs to. You have to create a line in this event segment file for each event of a participant that you want to analyse. If you have participants with multiple device ids you can choose any of them Example label,event_timestamp,length,shift,shift_direction,device_id stress1,1587661220000,1H,5M,1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress2,1587747620000,4H,4H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress3,1587906020000,3H,5M,1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress4,1584291600000,7H,4H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress5,1588172420000,9H,5M,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587661220000,1H,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587747620000,1D,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587906020000,7D,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 This example will create eight segments for a single participant ( a748ee1a... ), five independent stressX segments with various lengths (1,4,3,7, and 9 hours). Segments stress1 , stress3 , and stress5 are shifted forwards by 5 minutes and stress2 and stress4 are shifted backwards by 4 hours (that is, if the stress4 event happened on March 15 th at 1pm EST ( 1584291600000 ), the time segment will start on that day at 9am and end at 4pm). The three mood segments are 1 hour, 1 day and 7 days long and have no shift. In addition, these mood segments are grouped together, meaning that although RAPIDS will compute features on each one of them, some necessary information to compute a few of such features will be extracted from all three segments, for example the phone contact that called a participant the most or the location clusters visited by a participant.

For example, you might want to process data on every day, every morning, or only during weekends. RAPIDS offers three categories of time segments that are flexible enough to cover most use cases: frequency (short time windows every day), periodic (arbitrary time windows on any day), and event (arbitrary time windows around events of interest). See also our examples . Frequency Segments These segments are computed on every day and all have the same duration (for example 30 minutes). Set the following keys in your config.yaml TIME_SEGMENTS : &time_segments TYPE : FREQUENCY FILE : \"data/external/your_frequency_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE The file pointed by [TIME_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can only have 1 row. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your time segments length An integer representing the duration of your time segments in minutes Example label,length thirtyminutes,30 This configuration will compute 48 time segments for every day when any data from any participant was sensed. For example: start_time,length,label 00:00,30,thirtyminutes0000 00:30,30,thirtyminutes0001 01:00,30,thirtyminutes0002 01:30,30,thirtyminutes0003 ... Periodic Segments These segments can be computed every day, or on specific days of the week, month, quarter, and year. Their minimum duration is 1 minute but they can be as long as you want. Set the following keys in your config.yaml . TIME_SEGMENTS : &time_segments TYPE : PERIODIC FILE : \"data/external/your_periodic_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE # or TRUE If [INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS] is set to TRUE , RAPIDS will consider instances of your segments back enough in the past as to include the first row of data of each participant. For example, if the first row of data from a participant happened on Saturday March 7 th 2020 and the requested segment duration is 7 days starting on every Sunday, the first segment to be considered would start on Sunday March 1 st if [INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS] is TRUE or on Sunday March 8 th if FALSE . The file pointed by [TIME_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can have multiple rows. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your time segments. It has to be unique between rows start_time A string with format HH:MM:SS representing the starting time of this segment on any day length A string representing the length of this segment.It can have one or more of the following strings XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S repeats_on One of the follow options every_day , wday , qday , mday , and yday . The last four represent a week, quarter, month and year day repeats_value An integer complementing repeats_on . If you set repeats_on to every_day set this to 0 , otherwise 1-7 represent a wday starting from Mondays, 1-31 represent a mday , 1-91 represent a qday , and 1-366 represent a yday Example label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value daily,00:00:00,23H 59M 59S,every_day,0 morning,06:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 afternoon,12:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 evening,18:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 night,00:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 This configuration will create five segments instances ( daily , morning , afternoon , evening , night ) on any given day ( every_day set to 0). The daily segment will start at midnight and will last 23:59:59 , the other four segments will start at 6am, 12pm, 6pm, and 12am respectively and last for 05:59:59 . Event segments These segments can be computed before or after an event of interest (defined as any UNIX timestamp). Their minimum duration is 1 minute but they can be as long as you want. The start of each segment can be shifted backwards or forwards from the specified timestamp. Set the following keys in your config.yaml . TIME_SEGMENTS : &time_segments TYPE : EVENT FILE : \"data/external/your_event_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE # or TRUE The file pointed by [TIME_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can have multiple rows. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your time segments. If labels are unique, every segment is independent; if two or more segments have the same label, their data will be grouped when computing auxiliary data for features like the most frequent contact for calls (the most frequent contact will be computed across all these segments). There cannot be two overlaping event segments with the same label (RAPIDS will throw an error) event_timestamp A UNIX timestamp that represents the moment an event of interest happened (clinical relapse, survey, readmission, etc.). The corresponding time segment will be computed around this moment using length , shift , and shift_direction length A string representing the length of this segment. It can have one or more of the following keys XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S shift A string representing the time shift from event_timestamp . It can have one or more of the following keys XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent a number of days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S . Use this value to change the start of a segment with respect to its event_timestamp . For example, set this variable to 1H to create a segment that starts 1 hour from an event of interest ( shift_direction determines if it\u2019s before or after). shift_direction An integer representing whether the shift is before ( -1 ) or after ( 1 ) an event_timestamp device_id The device id (smartphone or fitbit) to whom this segment belongs to. You have to create a line in this event segment file for each event of a participant that you want to analyse. If you have participants with multiple device ids you can choose any of them Example label,event_timestamp,length,shift,shift_direction,device_id stress1,1587661220000,1H,5M,1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress2,1587747620000,4H,4H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress3,1587906020000,3H,5M,1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress4,1584291600000,7H,4H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress5,1588172420000,9H,5M,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587661220000,1H,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587747620000,1D,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587906020000,7D,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 This example will create eight segments for a single participant ( a748ee1a... ), five independent stressX segments with various lengths (1,4,3,7, and 9 hours). Segments stress1 , stress3 , and stress5 are shifted forwards by 5 minutes and stress2 and stress4 are shifted backwards by 4 hours (that is, if the stress4 event happened on March 15 th at 1pm EST ( 1584291600000 ), the time segment will start on that day at 9am and end at 4pm). The three mood segments are 1 hour, 1 day and 7 days long and have no shift. In addition, these mood segments are grouped together, meaning that although RAPIDS will compute features on each one of them, some necessary information to compute a few of such features will be extracted from all three segments, for example the phone contact that called a participant the most or the location clusters visited by a participant.","title":"Time Segments"},{"location":"setup/configuration/#segment-examples","text":"5-minutes Use the following Frequency segment file to create 288 (12 * 60 * 24) 5-minute segments starting from midnight of every day in your study label,length fiveminutes,5 Daily Use the following Periodic segment file to create daily segments starting from midnight of every day in your study label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value daily,00:00:00,23H 59M 59S,every_day,0 Morning Use the following Periodic segment file to create morning segments starting at 06:00:00 and ending at 11:59:59 of every day in your study label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value morning,06:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 Overnight Use the following Periodic segment file to create overnight segments starting at 20:00:00 and ending at 07:59:59 (next day) of every day in your study label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value morning,20:00:00,11H 59M 59S,every_day,0 Weekly Use the following Periodic segment file to create non-overlapping weekly segments starting at midnight of every Monday in your study label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value weekly,00:00:00,6D 23H 59M 59S,wday,1 Use the following Periodic segment file to create overlapping weekly segments starting at midnight of every day in your study label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value weekly,00:00:00,6D 23H 59M 59S,every_day,0 Week-ends Use the following Periodic segment file to create week-end segments starting at midnight of every Saturday in your study label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value weekend,00:00:00,1D 23H 59M 59S,wday,6 Around surveys Use the following Event segment file to create two 2-hour segments that start 1 hour before surveys answered by 3 participants label,event_timestamp,length,shift,shift_direction,device_id survey1,1587661220000,2H,1H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 survey2,1587747620000,2H,1H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 survey1,1587906020000,2H,1H,-1,rqtertsd-43ff-34fr-3eeg-efe4fergregr survey2,1584291600000,2H,1H,-1,rqtertsd-43ff-34fr-3eeg-efe4fergregr survey1,1588172420000,2H,1H,-1,klj34oi2-8frk-2343-21kk-324ljklewlr3 survey2,1584291600000,2H,1H,-1,klj34oi2-8frk-2343-21kk-324ljklewlr3","title":"Segment Examples"},{"location":"setup/configuration/#device-data-source-configuration","text":"You might need to modify the following config keys in your config.yaml depending on what devices your participants used and where you are storing your data.

Note Time segments (e.g. daily , morning , etc.) can have multiple instances (day 1, day 2, or morning 1, morning 2, etc.) 1. Histograms of phone data yield \u00b6 RAPIDS provides two histograms that show the number of time segment instances that had a certain ratio of valid yielded minutes and hours , respectively. A valid yielded minute has at least 1 row of data from any smartphone sensor and a valid yielded hour contains at least M valid minutes. These plots can be used as a rough indication of the smartphone monitoring coverage during a study aggregated across all participants. For example, the figure below shows a valid yielded minutes histogram for daily segments and we can infer that the monitoring coverage was very good since almost all segments contain at least 90 to 100% of the expected sensed minutes. Example Click here to see an example of these interactive visualizations in HTML format Histogram of the data yielded minute ratio for a single participant during five time segments (daily, afternoon, evening, and night) 2. Heatmaps of overall data yield \u00b6 These heatmaps are a break down per time segment and per participant of Visualization 1 . Heatmap\u2019s rows represent participants, columns represent time segment instances and the cells\u2019 color represent the valid yielded minute or hour ratio for a participant during a time segment instance. As different participants might join a study on different dates and time segments can be of any length and start on any day, the x-axis is labelled with the time delta between the start of each time segment instance minus the start of the first instance. These plots provide a quick study overview of the monitoring coverage per person and per time segment. The figure below shows the heatmap of the valid yielded minute ratio for participants t01 and t02 on daily segments and, as we inferred from the previous histogram, the lighter (yellow) color on most time segment instances (cells) indicate both phones sensed data without interruptions for most days (except for the first and last ones).

RAPIDS creates a plot per participant and per time segment and can be used as a rough indication of whether time-based sensors were following their sensing schedule (e.g. if location was being sensed every 2 minutes). The figure below shows this heatmap for phone sensors collected by participant t01 in daily time segments from Apr 23 rd 2020 to May 4 th 2020. We can infer that for most of the monitoring time, the participant\u2019s phone logged data from at least 8 sensors each minute.

In these heatmaps rows represent phone or Fitbit sensors, columns represent time segment instances and cell\u2019s color shows the normalized (0 to 1) row count of each sensor within a time segment instance.

From the top two rows, we can see that the phone was sensing data for most of the monitoring period (as suggested by Figure 3 and Figure 4). We can also infer how phone usage influenced the different sensor streams; there are peaks of screen events during the first day (Apr 23 rd ), peaks of location coordinates on Apr 26 th and Apr 30 th , and no sent or received SMS except for Apr 23 rd , Apr 29 th and Apr 30 th (unlabeled row between screen and locations).

This is because the cookiecutter data science file organization guidelines, the use of Snakemake, the provided behavioral features, and the reproducible R and Python development environments allow researchers to divide an analysis workflow into small parts that can be audited, shared in an online repository, reproduced in other computers, and understood by other people as they follow a familiar and consistent structure. We believe these advantages outweigh the time needed to learn how to create these workflows in RAPIDS. We clarify that to create analysis workflows in RAPIDS, researchers can still use any data manipulation tools, editors, libraries or languages they are already familiar with. RAPIDS is meant to be the final destination of analysis code that was developed in interactive notebooks or stand-alone scripts. For example, a user can compute call and location features using RAPIDS, then, they can use Jupyter notebooks to explore feature cleaning approaches and once the cleaning code is final, it can be moved to RAPIDS as a new step in the pipeline. In turn, the output of this cleaning step can be used to explore machine learning models and once a model is finished, it can also be transferred to RAPIDS as a step of its own. The idea is that when it is time to publish a piece of research, a RAPIDS workflow can be shared in a public repository as is. In the following sections we share an example of how we structured an analysis workflow in RAPIDS. Analysis workflow structure \u00b6 To accurately reflect the complexity of a real-world modeling scenario, we decided not to oversimplify this example. Importantly, every step in this example follows a basic structure: an input file and parameters are manipulated by an R or Python script that saves the results to an output file. Input files, parameters, output files and scripts are grouped into Snakemake rules that are described on smk files in the rules folder (we point the reader to the relevant rule(s) of each step). Researchers can use these rules and scripts as a guide to create their own as it is expected every modeling project will have different requirements, data and goals but ultimately most follow a similar chainned pattern. Hint The example\u2019s config file is example_profile/example_config.yaml and its Snakefile is in example_profile/Snakefile . The config file is already configured to process the sensor data as explained in Analysis workflow modules . Description of the study modeled in our analysis workflow example \u00b6 Our example is based on a hypothetical study that recruited 2 participants that underwent surgery and collected mobile data for at least one week before and one week after the procedure. Participants wore a Fitbit device and installed the AWARE client in their personal Android and iOS smartphones to collect mobile data 24/7. In addition, participants completed daily severity ratings of 12 common symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10 that we summed up into a daily symptom burden score. The goal of this workflow is to find out if we can predict the daily symptom burden score of a participant. Thus, we framed this question as a binary classification problem with two classes, high and low symptom burden based on the scores above and below average of each participant. We also want to compare the performance of individual (personalized) models vs a population model. In total, our example workflow has nine steps that are in charge of sensor data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature cleaning, machine learning model training and model evaluation (see figure below). We ship this workflow with RAPIDS and share a database with test data in an Open Science Framework repository. Modules of RAPIDS example workflow, from raw data to model evaluation Configure and run the analysis workflow example \u00b6 Install RAPIDS Configure the user credentials of a local or remote MySQL server with writing permissions in your .env file. The example config file is at example_profile/example_config.yaml . Unzip the test database to data/external/rapids_example.sql and run: ./rapids -j1 restore_sql_file --profile example_profile Create the participant files for this example by running: ./rapids -j1 create_example_participant_files Run the example pipeline with: ./rapids -j1 --profile example_profile Modules of our analysis workflow example \u00b6 1. Feature extraction We extract daily behavioral features for data yield, received and sent messages, missed, incoming and outgoing calls, resample fused location data using Doryab provider, activity recognition, battery, Bluetooth, screen, light, applications foreground, conversations, Wi-Fi connected, Wi-Fi visible, Fitbit heart rate summary and intraday data, Fitbit sleep summary data, and Fitbit step summary and intraday data without excluding sleep periods with an active bout threshold of 10 steps. In total, we obtained 237 daily sensor features over 12 days per participant. 2. Extract demographic data. It is common to have demographic data in addition to mobile and target (ground truth) data. In this example we include participants\u2019 age, gender and the number of days they spent in hospital after their surgery as features in our model. We extract these three columns from the participant_info table of our test database . As these three features remain the same within participants, they are used only on the population model. Refer to the demographic_features rule in rules/models.smk . 3. Create target labels. The two classes for our machine learning binary classification problem are high and low symptom burden. Target values are already stored in the participant_target table of our test database and transferred to a CSV file. A new rule/script can be created if further manipulation is necessary. Refer to the parse_targets rule in rules/models.smk . 4. Feature merging. These daily features are stored on a CSV file per sensor, a CSV file per participant, and a CSV file including all features from all participants (in every case each column represents a feature and each row represents a day). Refer to the merge_sensor_features_for_individual_participants and merge_features_for_population_model rules in rules/features.smk . 5. Data visualization. At this point the user can use the five plots RAPIDS provides (or implement new ones) to explore and understand the quality of the raw data and extracted features and decide what sensors, days, or participants to include and exclude. Refer to rules/reports.smk to find the rules that generate these plots. 6. Feature cleaning. In this stage we perform four steps to clean our sensor feature file. First, we discard days with a data yield hour ratio less than or equal to 0.75, i.e. we include days with at least 18 hours of data. Second, we drop columns (features) with more than 30% of missing rows. Third, we drop columns with zero variance. Fourth, we drop rows (days) with more than 30% of missing columns (features). In this cleaning stage several parameters are created and exposed in example_profile/example_config.yaml . After this step, we kept 162 features over 11 days for the individual model of p01, 107 features over 12 days for the individual model of p02 and 101 features over 20 days for the population model. Note that the difference in the number of features between p01 and p02 is mostly due to iOS restrictions that stops researchers from collecting the same number of sensors than in Android phones. Feature cleaning for the individual models is done in the clean_sensor_features_for_individual_participants rule and for the population model in the clean_sensor_features_for_all_participants rule in rules/models.smk . 7. Merge features and targets. In this step we merge the cleaned features and target labels for our individual models in the merge_features_and_targets_for_individual_model rule in rules/models.smk . Additionally, we merge the cleaned features, target labels, and demographic features of our two participants for the population model in the merge_features_and_targets_for_population_model rule in rules/models.smk . These two merged files are the input for our individual and population models. 8. Modelling. This stage has three phases: model building, training and evaluation. In the building phase we impute, normalize and oversample our dataset. Missing numeric values in each column are imputed with their mean and we impute missing categorical values with their mode. We normalize each numeric column with one of three strategies (min-max, z-score, and scikit-learn package\u2019s robust scaler) and we one-hot encode each categorial feature as a numerical array. We oversample our imbalanced dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or a Random Over sampler from scikit-learn. All these parameters are exposed in example_profile/example_config.yaml . In the training phase, we create eight models: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting classifier, extreme gradient boosting classifier and a light gradient boosting machine. We cross-validate each model with an inner cycle to tune hyper-parameters based on the Macro F1 score and an outer cycle to predict the test set on a model with the best hyper-parameters. Both cross-validation cycles use a leave-one-out strategy. Parameters for each model like weights and learning rates are exposed in example_profile/example_config.yaml . Finally, in the evaluation phase we compute the accuracy, Macro F1, kappa, area under the curve and per class precision, recall and F1 score of all folds of the outer cross-validation cycle. Refer to the modelling_for_individual_participants rule for the individual modeling and to the modelling_for_all_participants rule for the population modeling, both in rules/models.smk . 9. Compute model baselines. We create three baselines to evaluate our classification models. First, a majority classifier that labels each test sample with the majority class of our training data. Second, a random weighted classifier that predicts each test observation sampling at random from a binomial distribution based on the ratio of our target labels. Third, a decision tree classifier based solely on the demographic features of each participant. As we do not have demographic features for individual model, this baseline is only available for population model. Our baseline metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, etc.) are saved into a CSV file, ready to be compared to our modeling results. Refer to the baselines_for_individual_model rule for the individual model baselines and to the baselines_for_population_model rule for population model baselines, both in rules/models.smk .","title":"Analysis"},{"location":"workflow-examples/analysis/#analysis-workflow-example","text":"TL;DR In addition to using RAPIDS to extract behavioral features and create plots, you can structure your data analysis within RAPIDS (i.e. cleaning your features and creating ML/statistical models) We include an analysis example in RAPIDS that covers raw data processing, cleaning, feature extraction, machine learning modeling, and evaluation Use this example as a guide to structure your own analysis within RAPIDS RAPIDS analysis workflows are compatible with your favorite data science tools and libraries RAPIDS analysis workflows are reproducible and we encourage you to publish them along with your research papers","title":"Analysis Workflow Example"},{"location":"workflow-examples/analysis/#why-should-i-integrate-my-analysis-in-rapids","text":"Even though the bulk of RAPIDS current functionality is related to the computation of behavioral features, we recommend RAPIDS as a complementary tool to create a mobile data analysis workflow.

We oversample our imbalanced dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or a Random Over sampler from scikit-learn. All these parameters are exposed in example_profile/example_config.yaml . In the training phase, we create eight models: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting classifier, extreme gradient boosting classifier and a light gradient boosting machine. We cross-validate each model with an inner cycle to tune hyper-parameters based on the Macro F1 score and an outer cycle to predict the test set on a model with the best hyper-parameters. Both cross-validation cycles use a leave-one-out strategy. Parameters for each model like weights and learning rates are exposed in example_profile/example_config.yaml . Finally, in the evaluation phase we compute the accuracy, Macro F1, kappa, area under the curve and per class precision, recall and F1 score of all folds of the outer cross-validation cycle. Refer to the modelling_for_individual_participants rule for the individual modeling and to the modelling_for_all_participants rule for the population modeling, both in rules/models.smk . 9. Compute model baselines. We create three baselines to evaluate our classification models. First, a majority classifier that labels each test sample with the majority class of our training data. Second, a random weighted classifier that predicts each test observation sampling at random from a binomial distribution based on the ratio of our target labels. Third, a decision tree classifier based solely on the demographic features of each participant. As we do not have demographic features for individual model, this baseline is only available for population model. Our baseline metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, etc.) are saved into a CSV file, ready to be compared to our modeling results. Refer to the baselines_for_individual_model rule for the individual model baselines and to the baselines_for_population_model rule for population model baselines, both in rules/models.smk .","title":"Modules of our analysis workflow example"},{"location":"workflow-examples/minimal/","text":"Minimal Working Example \u00b6 This is a quick guide for creating and running a simple pipeline to extract missing, outgoing, and incoming call features for daily and night epochs of one participant monitored on the US East coast.
