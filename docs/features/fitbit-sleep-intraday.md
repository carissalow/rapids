|`[COMPUTE]`                                  | Set to `True` to extract `FITBIT_SLEEP_INTRADAY` features from the `RAPIDS` provider|
|`[FEATURES]`                                 |         Features to be computed from sleep intraday data, see table below           |
|`[SLEEP_LEVELS]`                             | Fitbitâ€™s sleep API Version 1 only provides `CLASSIC` records. However, Version 1.2 provides 2 types of records: `CLASSIC` and `STAGES`. `STAGES` is only available in devices with a heart rate sensor and even those devices will fail to report it if the battery is low or the device is not tight enough. While `CLASSIC` contains 3 sleep levels (`awake`, `restless`, and `asleep`), `STAGES` contains 4 sleep levels (`wake`, `deep`, `light`, `rem`). To make it consistent, RAPIDS groups them into 2 `UNIFIED` sleep levels: `awake` (`CLASSIC`: `awake` and `restless`; `STAGES`: `wake`) and `asleep` (`CLASSIC`: `asleep`; `STAGES`: `deep`, `light`, and `rem`). In this section, there is a boolean flag named `INCLUDE_ALL_GROUPS` that if set to TRUE, computes LEVELS_AND_TYPES features grouping all levels together in a single `all` category.
|`[SLEEP_TYPES]`                              | Types of sleep to be included in the feature extraction computation. There are three sleep types: `main`, `nap`, and `all`. The `all` type means both main sleep and naps are considered.

!!! note "Assumptions/Observations"
    1. [This diagram](../../img/sleep_intraday_rapids.png) will help you understand how sleep episodes are chunked and grouped within time segments for the RAPIDS provider.
    1. Features listed in `[LEVELS_AND_TYPES]` are computed for any levels and types listed in `[SLEEP_LEVELS]` or `[SLEEP_TYPES]`. For example if `STAGES` only contains `[rem, light]` you will not get `countepisode[wake|deep][TYPE]` or sum, max, min, avg, median, or std `duration`. Levels or types in these lists do not influence `RATIOS` or `ROUTINE` features.
    2. Any `[LEVEL]` grouping is done within the elements of each class `CLASSIC`, `STAGES`, and `UNIFIED`. That is, we never combine `CLASSIC` or `STAGES` types to compute features.
    3. The categories for `all` levels (when `INCLUDE_ALL_GROUPS` is `True`) and `all` `SLEEP_TYPES` are not considered for `RATIOS` features as they are always 1.
    3. These features can be computed in time segments of any length, but only the 1-minute sleep chunks within each segment instance will be used.

!!! note "Assumptions/Observations"
    1. [This diagram](../../img/sleep_intraday_price.png) will help you understand how sleep episodes are chunked and grouped within time segments and `LNE-LNE` intervals for the PRICE provider.
    1. We recommend you use periodic segments that start in the morning so RAPIDS can chunk and group sleep episodes overnight. Shifted segments (as any other segments) are labelled based on their start and end date times.
    5. `avgstarttime...` and `avgendtime...` are roughly equivalent to an average bed and awake time only if you are using shifted segments.
    1. The features of this provider are only available on time segments that are longer than 24 hours because they are based on descriptive statistics computed across daily values.
    2. Even though Fitbit provides 2 types of sleep episodes (`main` and `nap`), only `main` sleep episodes are considered.
    4. The reference point for all times is 00:00 of the first day in the LNE-LNE interval.
    5. Sleep episodes are formed by 1-minute chunks that we group overnight starting from todayâ€™s LNE and ending on tomorrowâ€™s LNE or the end of that segment (whatever is first). 
    5. The features `avgstarttime...` and `avgendtime...` are the average of the first and last sleep episode across every LNE-LNE interval within a segment (`avgmidtime...` is the mid point between start and end). Therefore, only segments longer than 24hrs will be averaged across more than one LNE-LNE interval.
    5. `socialjetlag` is only available on segment instances equal or longer than 48hrs that contain at least one weekday day and one weekend day, for example seven-day (weekly) segments.
